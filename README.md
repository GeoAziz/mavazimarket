## üíª Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mavazi-market.git
    cd mavazi-market
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    - Populate it with all the same keys listed above in the "Vercel Environment Variables" section. Refer to `.env.example` for the required keys.
    
4.  **Populate the Database:**
    - Place your Firebase Admin SDK service account key file in the project root. The script expects it to be named `mavazi-market-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-c781dbd1ae.json`.
    - Run the population script to seed your Firestore database with mock categories, products, and users (including an admin user).
    ```bash
    npm run populate-db
    ```
    - The script will create an admin user with the email `admin@mixostore.com` and password `Mixo123!`.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps & Future Enhancements

The core application is complete. Future work would focus on integrating production-ready external services.

-   [ ] **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement a real payment provider like Stripe or a local Kenyan alternative (e.g., M-Pesa API via DARAJA).
-   [ ] **Cloud Storage for Images:** Connect the product and category image upload forms to Firebase Storage or another cloud provider.
-   [ ] **Implement Real Admin Actions:** Replace mocked admin actions (e.g., changing user roles, bulk updates) with secure Firebase Cloud Functions.
-   [ ] **Server-Side Search:** Implement a robust search feature that queries the database directly instead of filtering on the client.
-   [ ] **Add End-to-End Testing:** Implement a testing framework like Cypress or Playwright to ensure application reliability.
